Once an OCP cluster is built, it's a good idea to understand a few pieces of information to properly size the cluster based on the hardware that you are using.  These pieces of information should be gathered before any additional/custom workloads are added but can include the base OCP components and OCP operators such as ODF, Quay registry, ACM (Advanced Cluster Management), and ACS (Advanced Cluster Security) if you wish.
